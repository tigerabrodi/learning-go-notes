The key takeaway from this document about major version updates in Go is how uniquely Go handles them compared to other languages:

In Go, a new major version (v2+) is treated as an entirely new module with a different import path. This is a significant design decision that affects both module authors and users.

Important points:

1. The module path itself must change to include the version number:

   - v1: `example.com/mymodule`
   - v2: `example.com/mymodule/v2`

2. All imports (even within your own code) must be updated to reference the new path.

3. From Go's perspective, v1 and v2 of your module are completely separate modules that can coexist in the same program.

4. This approach forces explicit adoption of breaking changes, preventing accidental breakage.

5. The recommended workflow is to create a new branch for the major version development.

This approach has both pros and cons:

- Pro: Makes breaking changes extremely explicit
- Pro: Allows gradual migration (users can use v1 and v2 in the same program)
- Con: Requires significant effort to update imports
- Con: Authors need to maintain multiple versions

This is one of Go's more controversial design decisions, but it ensures that dependency management remains stable and predictable even when modules evolve with breaking changes.
