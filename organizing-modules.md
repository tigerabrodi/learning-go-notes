1. **Use of `internal/` directory**: This is a special directory in Go that prevents packages inside it from being imported by code outside your module. It's excellent for helper packages that you don't want to expose as part of your public API.

2. **Multiple executable commands**: If your project has multiple commands, the convention is to put them in a `cmd/` directory with subdirectories for each command.

3. **Server organization**: For server projects, the document recommends keeping implementation logic in `internal/` and executables in `cmd/`, which helps separate the Go code from other project artifacts (front-end files, configs, etc.).

4. **Package naming**: The document reinforces that package names should match their directory names (the last part of the import path).

The document essentially confirms what we discussed about module organization, but provides more examples for different project types. The main takeaway is that Go has these established conventions that help projects remain maintainable and understandable as they grow.

What's nice about the Go way is that you can start simple and gradually introduce more structure (like adding `internal/` or `cmd/` directories) as your project's needs evolve, without having to redesign everything.
