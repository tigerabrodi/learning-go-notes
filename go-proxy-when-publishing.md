Making your module available on the Go proxy isn't strictly necessary for the module to be usable. When you push your Git tags, your module is already technically "published" in the sense that anyone can use it with `go get`.

The Go proxy system (proxy.golang.org) acts as a cache and CDN for Go modules. The reason for running:

```bash
GOPROXY=proxy.golang.org go list -m example.com/mymodule@v1.0.0
```

is to "prime the cache" - to ensure your module is indexed by the Go proxy system. This provides several benefits:

1. Faster downloads for users (modules are cached on the proxy)
2. Persistence (even if your repository goes down, the proxy still has the code)
3. Availability in environments that can't directly access GitHub/GitLab
4. Protection against repository history changes

When a user runs `go get`, Go will first check the proxy for the module before going to the source repository.

This step is technically optional, but recommended. Your module will eventually get into the proxy system anyway the first time someone uses `go get` to download it, but proactively adding it to the proxy ensures immediate availability.
