## Publishing a Module

The process is refreshingly simple:

1. **Prepare your code**:

   - Run `go mod tidy` to clean up dependencies
   - Run tests with `go test ./...`

2. **Tag the version in Git**:

   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Make it available on the Go proxy**:
   ```bash
   GOPROXY=proxy.golang.org go list -m example.com/mymodule@v1.0.0
   ```

That's it! No need to create accounts on package registries or upload artifacts. The Go ecosystem uses your Git repository as the source of truth.

## Version Numbering in Go

Go strictly follows semantic versioning with some extra conventions:

1. **v0.x.x** - Development versions with no stability guarantees

   - Use this for early development when your API might change frequently

2. **v1.x.x+** - Stable versions with backward compatibility promises

   - Major version (v1, v2, etc.) - Breaking changes, requires new import path for v2+
   - Minor version (x.1, x.2, etc.) - New features, backward compatible
   - Patch version (x.x.1, x.x.2) - Bug fixes only

3. **Pre-release versions** like `v1.2.0-beta.1` - Testing releases before a formal version

4. **Pseudo-versions** like `v0.0.0-20210101150930-abcdef123456` - Automatically generated when using unreleased code

The unique aspect of Go's versioning is the handling of major versions v2 and above. These require:

1. Changing the module path in go.mod to include `/v2`
2. Updating all imports to include `/v2`

This approach reinforces that a new major version is essentially a new module, making breaking changes completely explicit to users.

The Go versioning model helps maintain a stable ecosystem by making compatibility guarantees very clear and by treating breaking changes with the seriousness they deserve.
